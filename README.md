# Mail-Archive

My personal, read-only mirror for mailing list archives.

## About

This project exists because [Pipermail](https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman-member/node9.html) has a terrible web interface. It's more-or-less a stock deployment of [HyperKitty](https://docs.mailman3.org/projects/hyperkitty/en/latest/) without the integration to GNU Mailman. Because I do not host any mailing lists myself, I wrote a script to periodically scrape public archives from the web.
